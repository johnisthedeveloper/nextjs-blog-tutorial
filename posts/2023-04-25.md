Why is the sky blue?

The sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by the Earth's atmosphere. 
The Earth's atmosphere is made up of tiny molecules, and when sunlight enters the atmosphere, it collides with these molecules, causing them to scatter light in all directions. 
Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered more easily than other colors, which is why we see a blue sky during the day. 
As the sun sets or rises, the light travels through more of the Earth's atmosphere, causing blue light to be scattered even more and resulting in colorful sunrises and sunsets.

天空为什么是蓝色的？

天空之所以呈现蓝色，是因为太阳光在地球大气层中的散射。

地球的大气层由微小分子组成，当太阳光进入大气层时，它会与这些分子碰撞，使它们将光线向各个方向散射。

蓝色光具有较短的波长，并且比其他颜色更容易被散射，这就是为什么我们在白天看到蓝色天空的原因。

随着太阳升起或落下，光线穿过更多的地球大气层，在导致蓝色光更加散射的同时也产生了丰富多彩的日出和日落景象。
